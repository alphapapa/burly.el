Burly.el
********

This package provides tools to save and restore frame and window
configurations in Emacs, including buffers that may not be live anymore.
In this way, it’s like a lightweight "workspace" manager, allowing you
to easily restore one or more frames, including their windows, the
windows’ layout, and their buffers.

   Internally it uses Emacs’s bookmarks system to restore buffers to
their previous contents and location.  This provides power and
extensibility, since many major modes already integrate with Emacs’s
bookmarks system.  However, in case a mode’s bookmarking function isn’t
satisfactory, Burly allows the user to customize buffer-restoring
functions for specific modes.

   For Org mode, Burly provides such custom functions so that narrowed
and indirect Org buffers are properly restored, and headings are located
by outline path in case they’ve moved since a bookmark was made (the
org-bookmark-heading (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-bookmark-heading)
package also provides this through the Emacs bookmark system, but users
may not have it installed, and the functionality is too useful to not
include here by default).

   Internally, buffers and frame/window configurations are also encoded
as URLs, and users may also save and open those URLs instead of using
Emacs bookmarks.  (The name "Burly" comes from "buffer URL.") For
example, a URL to the ‘Installation/Quelpa’ heading in this file, as I’m
writing it, looks like this:

     emacs+burly+file:///home/me/src/emacs/burly.el/README.org?pos=2651&outline-path=%28%22Installation%22%20%22Quelpa%22%29&relative-pos=308

   In terms of built-in features, Burly may be seen as integrating or
leveraging the built-in libraries ‘bookmark.el’, ‘window.el’, and
‘frameset.el’.

2.1 Bookmark commands
=====================

Most users will probably use Burly by bookmarking frame and window
configurations and accessing them with these commands:

   • ‘burly-bookmark-frames’: Bookmark the current frames and their
     window configurations.
   • ‘burly-bookmark-windows’: Bookmark the current frame’s window
     configuration.
   • ‘burly-open-bookmark’: Select and open a Burly bookmark.
   • ‘burly-open-last-bookmark’: Open the last-opened Burly bookmark.
     Helpful for, e.g.  quickly restoring an overview while working on a
     project.

   Note that bookmarks created by Burly are regular Emacs bookmarks, so
they can be managed by Emacs’s built-in bookmark commands, e.g.
‘list-bookmarks’, ‘bookmark-delete’, etc.

2.2 URL commands
================

These commands work on URL strings.  While most users probably won’t use
these, they may be useful for building custom tooling.

   • ‘burly-open-url’: Open a Burly URL (at point, or prompt for one),
     displaying the buffer(s) in the current window or frame.
   • ‘burly-kill-buffer-url’: Copy BUFFER’s URL to the kill ring.
   • ‘burly-kill-frames-url’: Copy the current frameset’s URL to the
     kill ring.
   • ‘burly-kill-windows-url’: Copy the current frame’s window
     configuration URL to the kill ring.

3.1 0.2-pre
===========

*Added*
   • Bookmark commands use ‘completing-read’ and offer existing Burly
     bookmark names, making it easier to update bookmarks.  (Thanks to
     Erik Sjöstrand (https://github.com/Kungsgeten).)
   • Command ‘burly-open-last-bookmark’.

   *Changed*
   • Option ‘burly-window-persistent-parameters’’s default value
     includes more window parameters, like header/mode line, side, slot,
     etc, making it easier to restore an overview of a project or
     "workspace."

   *Fixed*
   • Narrow Org buffers to correct heading (at the top of the buffer
     rather than at point).
